            <p>&nbsp; Yorkshire Terrier also known as a Yorkie are known for being lap dogs. Since they are smaller dogs they don't require a huge amount of space or exercise, which makes them great dogs if you live in an apartment or an older couple. Yorkies are happiest when they are perched on their owner's lap or nearby their owners. But, most importantly they love physical contact. </p>
