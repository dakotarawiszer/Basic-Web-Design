            <h2>Why Dogs Are Good For Your Mental Health</h2>

            <p> &nbsp; Dogs are good for your mental health for many reasons. Dogs can reduce stress, anxiety, depression, ease loneliness, encourage exercise, and improve your over all health. When having a dog you have to do certain things in order to keep the dog healthy, such as, walking the dog and by walking him you get to meet new people whether it be in your neighborhood or a dog park. By meeting new people you are being social and getting outside unlike if you didnt have a dog. </p>

            <p> &nbsp; All types of dog breeds can be YOUR mental support dog but some breeds are better than others. People immediately think of a golden retriever or lab as an emotional support dog but there are many types that fit this category. The Yorkshire terrier is a small breed that will weigh usually under 10 pounds. But most people feel more at ease with a larger breed because they feel safer. Of course any emotional support dog must be authorized by a licensed health professional. This does not allow them the same rights as a service dog but it definitely gives more leniency. </p>
