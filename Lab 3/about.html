    <h2>About hiking</h2>
    <p>Hiking is one of my favorite things to do. It helps me by clearing my mind and letting me explore and see new things in nature. Hiking is a very good cardio workout as well. I hate working out but when I go hiking I don't feel like I'm working out like I would be if I was at the gym. Hiking is a weight-bearing exercise which builds muscle mass. Being in nature can even change your moods and can even imprive mental health. Spending time outdoors can reduce stress and can calm anxiety. These are the main reasons I like hiking.</p>
    <h3>What hiking means to me</h3>
    <p>When hiking I always think of my grandmother who passed away a few years ago because she knew every type of flower there was and she would telling me all these cool facts about them. So, when I go hiking it always reminds me of her and makes me remember all the great times we had together. I love seeing new places and especially if it has a waterfall at the end of the hike. One of my favorite hikes I've been on is at Fall Creek Falls. Everything about that place is beautiful, the plants, how the rocks form, and the best part is the waterfall. It is really cool to see all the wildlife as well expect snakes. That's one thing I have never liked about hiking. </p>
