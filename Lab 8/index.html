                <h2>What is Vinterest?</h2>
                <p>Vinterest is an antique shop locally owned where people rent out booths and sell their own items. There are different sizes of booths people can rent out monthly. Although all the spaces are normally full when there is a space open it is NOT first come first serve, it is whatever is unique to the store. We do not want to add a new vendor who is selling candles if we already have someone selling candles and making a profit, we do not want any competition!</p>

                <p>We also have two stores total! One is in Hixson and it's called Vinterest Antiques and has won Best Antique store 6 years in a row! The other one is on the Southside called Vinterest Southside which has been open for 3 years now!</p>

                        The prices are the same for other stores and it depends on the size booth you are interested in. The prices ranges from $50-$550 per month. The least expensive would be a book shelf and the most expensive would be an 8 by 20 booth.
