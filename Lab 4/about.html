    <h2>About Hiking</h2>
    <p>Hiking is one of my favorite things to do. It helps me by clearing my mind and letting me explore and see new things in nature. Hiking is a very good cardio workout as well. I hate working out but when I go hiking I don't feel like I'm working out like I would be if I was at the gym. Hiking is a weight-bearing exercise which builds muscle mass. Being in nature can even change your moods and can even improve mental health. Spending time outdoors can reduce stress and can calm anxiety. These are the main reasons I like hiking.</p>
    <h3>Types of Hikes</h3>
    <p>There are several types of hikes a person can take. When hiking you can either walk, run, ride your bike, or even hike without trails and make your own. When making your own trails a good tip I've learned is to leave something behind so you know which way to go on your way back or to just remember. Some people just go hiking to take pictures of their surrounding areas such as nature, plants, animals, or  waterfalls. I go hiking to release stress and to see a waterfall if my trail has on. You need to make sure you wear the right tennis shoes or hiking boots and to bring water. </p>
